🚀 Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized businesses often struggle to keep track of required documents, licenses, and compliance deadlines. Missing renewals or failing to maintain proper documentation can lead to:<br>  

💸 Heavy fines<br>  

⚖️ Legal issues<br>  

📉 Loss of credibility<br>  

Currently, there is no simple and affordable system to automatically check, validate, and guide businesses in staying compliant.
A single missed renewal or incorrect document can lead to crippling fines, legal complications, and a devastating loss of business credibility. Existing solutions are often complex, expensive, or not tailored for the needs of small entrepreneurs.

💡 Proposed Solution

MicroAudit is a mobile-first application that empowers small business owners by:
✅ Allowing users to scan or upload documents<br>  
✅ Extracting important details with AI-powered OCR<br>  
✅ Automatically checking compliance rules<br>  
✅ Sending renewal reminders & alerts<br>  
✅ Guiding entrepreneurs with required licenses & documents based on business type<br>  

This makes compliance easy, affordable, and stress-free for entrepreneurs and shopkeepers.

From providing a clear roadmap of required licenses for a new cafe to sending timely renewal alerts for an existing shop, MicroAudit is the all-in-one compliance partner for every small business.

✅ Automatic Compliance Checks: The app cross-references your documents against a regularly updated database of rules and regulations specific to your business type and location.<br>  

🗺️ Personalized Guidance System: Are you starting a new business? MicroAudit provides a personalized checklist of all the documents and licenses you need, taking the guesswork out of getting started.<br>

📊 Progress Tracking Dashboard: A clear and simple dashboard shows you which documents are compliant, which are expiring soon, and which are still pending.<br>  

🎯 Target Audience
Small Business Owners<br>  

Entrepreneurs & Startups<br>  

Local Shopkeepers & Service Providers (e.g., cafes, salons, consultants)<br>  

🎯 Expected Outcome<br>  

A functional mobile app where business owners can:<br>  
✔️ Scan & manage documents<br>  
✔️ Receive compliance status reports<br>  
✔️ Get renewal reminders<br>  
✔️ Know exactly what licenses are required<br>  

👉 This reduces risks of fines, penalties, and legal issues by ensuring compliance is never missed.<br>
