🚀 Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized businesses often struggle to keep track of required documents, licenses, and compliance deadlines. Missing renewals or failing to maintain proper documentation can lead to:

💸 Heavy fines

⚖️ Legal issues

📉 Loss of credibility

Currently, there is no simple and affordable system to automatically check, validate, and guide businesses in staying compliant.
A single missed renewal or incorrect document can lead to crippling fines, legal complications, and a devastating loss of business credibility. Existing solutions are often complex, expensive, or not tailored for the needs of small entrepreneurs.

💡 Proposed Solution

MicroAudit is a mobile-first application that empowers small business owners by:
✅ Allowing users to scan or upload documents
✅ Extracting important details with AI-powered OCR
✅ Automatically checking compliance rules
✅ Sending renewal reminders & alerts
✅ Guiding entrepreneurs with required licenses & documents based on business type

This makes compliance easy, affordable, and stress-free for entrepreneurs and shopkeepers.

From providing a clear roadmap of required licenses for a new cafe to sending timely renewal alerts for an existing shop, MicroAudit is the all-in-one compliance partner for every small business.

🚀 Key Features
📄 Document Scanning & Uploading: Digitize your important documents in seconds using your mobile camera or by uploading files directly.

🤖 AI-Powered OCR Extraction: Our intelligent OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine automatically reads and extracts key details like expiry dates, license numbers, and entity names from your documents.

✅ Automatic Compliance Checks: The app cross-references your documents against a regularly updated database of rules and regulations specific to your business type and location.

🗺️ Personalized Guidance System: Are you starting a new business? MicroAudit provides a personalized checklist of all the documents and licenses you need, taking the guesswork out of getting started.

🔔 Smart Renewal Reminders: Receive timely alerts and push notifications well before your important documents are due for renewal, giving you ample time to act.

📊 Progress Tracking Dashboard: A clear and simple dashboard shows you which documents are compliant, which are expiring soon, and which are still pending.

🎯 Target Audience
Small Business Owners

Entrepreneurs & Startups

Local Shopkeepers & Service Providers (e.g., cafes, salons, consultants)

🎯 Expected Outcome

A functional mobile app where business owners can:
✔️ Scan & manage documents
✔️ Receive compliance status reports
✔️ Get renewal reminders
✔️ Know exactly what licenses are required

👉 This reduces risks of fines, penalties, and legal issues by ensuring compliance is never missed.
