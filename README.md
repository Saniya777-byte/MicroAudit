##  Real-World Problem

Small businesses, freelancers, and entrepreneurs deal with many recurring tasks, documents, bills, and resources. But most of them still manage work using:

-  Scattered WhatsApp chats  
-  Random notes or paper diaries  
-  Unorganized folders  
-  No reminders for renewals or deadlines  
-  No proper workspace separation  

This leads to lost documents, missed deadlines, and zero visibility on progress.

There is **no simple, mobile-first solution** that combines **tasks + documents + resources + workspaces** in one unified system.
