🧐 Problem Statement
For small and medium-sized businesses, navigating the maze of compliance is a constant challenge. Keeping track of required documents, licenses, and crucial deadlines is a manual and error-prone process.

A single missed renewal or incorrect document can lead to crippling fines, legal complications, and a devastating loss of business credibility. Existing solutions are often complex, expensive, or not tailored for the needs of small entrepreneurs.
