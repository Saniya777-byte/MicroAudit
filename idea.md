Saniya Jabbar Khatik – 2024-B-20072005

3. Problem Statement
Small and medium-sized businesses often struggle to keep track of required documents, licenses, and compliance deadlines. Missing renewals or not having the correct documentation can lead to fines, legal issues, and loss of credibility. There is no simple, affordable system to automatically check these documents, guide business owners, and remind them before problems occur.

4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A mobile application that allows business owners to scan or upload their important documents. The system will read the documents using AI-based OCR, check their validity against predefined rules for the business type and location, and provide renewal reminders. In addition, the app will guide new or existing business owners by recommending which documents and licenses are required for their industry, making it easier to start and maintain a compliant business.

5. Key Features

•Document scanning and uploading via mobile camera or file upload.
•AI-powered OCR to read document details like expiry date, license number, etc.
•Automatic compliance checks against a rule database.
•Personalized guidance for required documents based on business type.
•Renewal reminders and alerts before deadlines.
•Progress tracking for collected and pending documents.

8. Expected Outcome
A functional mobile app where business owners can scan and manage documents, receive compliance status reports, get renewal reminders, and be guided on what documentation is required for their business type. The system will reduce the risk of fines and legal issues by ensuring businesses stay compliant.
