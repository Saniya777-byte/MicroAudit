# 3. Problem Statement
Small business owners, freelancers, and entrepreneurs often struggle to organize their tasks, documents, resources, and projects. Existing solutions involve multiple apps, paper notes, or scattered digital files, which can result in:

- Missed deadlines and incomplete tasks  
- Lost documents and resources  
- Poor visibility of progress and project status  
- Difficulty managing multiple workspaces or projects simultaneously  

There is no simple, mobile-first system that combines **task management, document storage, and workspace organization** in one unified platform.

# 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
**MicroAudit** is a mobile application designed to help individuals and small teams stay organized. It allows users to:

- Create multiple **workspaces** for personal, work, or project-related tasks  
- Manage **tasks** within each workspace with priorities, due dates, and completion tracking  
- Upload and organize **documents** and files securely  
- Store and display **resources** like images and links in a structured way  
- Receive reminders and track progress within each workspace  

By centralizing all work-related activities, MicroAudit reduces chaos, improves productivity, and ensures that tasks and resources are always accessible.
